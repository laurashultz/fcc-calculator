# fcc-calculator
## Functionality
* This web app was developed to satisfy a portion of the [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) Front End Libraries certification. 
* The test suite for this project appears as an overlay on the upper left-hand corner of the app, and it can be run by selecting 'Javascript Calculator' from the drop-down box, and clicking "run tests".
* The primary function of this app is to provide basic calculator functionality.
* The layout of the calculator mimics the layout of a regular number pad.
* The app itself is intended to be responsive to changes in device size and text size, so feel free to zoom in or out.

## Web App Deployment
* If you would like to view the app itself, it's been deployed on GitHub pages! Please see [the deployed Calculator web app here](https://loofmot.github.io/fcc-calculator/).
* If you are interested in downloading the project and viewing it locally, you may clone the repo, navigate to the directory, and run the command `npm start` to view it in a local environment. If the command is run in the root directory of the repository, the app will be viewable by navigating to "localhost:3000" in your web browser.

## Future Updates
* Keyboard use for accessibility
* Improve user interface


## Issues
* If you encounter any loss of functionality at any time while using the app, I would appreciate feedback!
